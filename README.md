# EvoVis

EvoVis is a dashboard for visualizing Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) algorithms. ENAS mimics biological evolution to discover optimal neural network architectures, starting with a population of randomly generated architectures and iteratively improving them through selection, crossover, and mutation.

## Key Features

1. **Hyperparameter Overview:** Efficiently tune hyperparameters with an overview of settings.
2. **Gene Pool Graph:** Visualize potential neural architecture topologies and connectivity patterns across generations.
3. **Family Tree Graph:** Navigate the family tree of architectures, analyze performance metrics, and explore structures.
4. **Performance Plots:** Monitor performance trends in real-time with evolutionary metrics.
5. **Data Structure Interface:** Support for visualizing ENAS results from various frameworks and sources.

EvoVis offers a holistic view of the ENAS process. It provides insights into architectural evolution and performance optimization.

## Installation

1. Clone the EvoVis repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/leadang42/EvoNAS-Dashboard.git).
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
